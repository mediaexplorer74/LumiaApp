# Lumia Settings Application (LumiaApp) 

## Description
This repository is Lumia Settings App prototype (draft, sketch). 
(the original source code for the Lumia Settings application shipped as part of the LumiaWOA project). 
This is my try to run Lumia Settings app on my Windows 10 Mobile "smart device".
Please note: this is only technology prototype, resolt of my micro-RnD. 

## Screenshots

## Known issues
- Some XAML incompatibility with Win10Mobile build 15063. But this code runs on Win11... 
- Magisk package/lib was temporaty disabled because of some .NET Standard 1.6 problems :)

## Installation

No binaris/execs. DIY!

For developers:
- Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads).

- Install the "Universal Windows Platform Development" workload.

- Install the Windows 10 SDK build 15063.

- Clone the code repository.

- Open [LumiaApp.sln](/LumiaApp.sln) with Visual Studio , choose x86 or ARM target and start your journey! ;)
